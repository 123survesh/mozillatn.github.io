Last year Mozilla Tamilnadu community contributors started an initiative  called as weeks of contribution. The main aim of this initiative is to bring first time contributors to contribute to Mozilla Community. We really had great impact in this, around 15 new contributors joined our community and helping to grow us very well. Learn those who joined us last year newly and active [Weeks of Contribution 2015 Report](https://viswaprasathks.wordpress.com/2015/09/06/weeks-of-contribution-impact-on-me-community-part-3/)

We are again bringing this back to bring awesome set of contributors to Mozilla again. Last year we had some difficulties in teaching to our contributors, as we had most of the things in online. This time we are making a small change. We are going to bring Weeks of Contribution near you in different community spaces  and Colleges. Interested people can goto the spaces and learn. As of now the plan is to start on July 1st Weekend and have in the alternative weeks, and trainers will be teaching regarding Localisation, Support Mozilla, Add-ons development, Quality Assurance. 

**As of now community spaces where Weeks of Contribution going to happen are as follows**
- Villupuram(Bodhi Academy)
- Erode (F-infotech)
- Madurai (Community Space)
- Salem (The Salem Startups)
- Vellore (Community Space)

But we are not going to restrict with these places alone, we are inviting contributors who can come forward to teach and help other in their communities to gain knowledge about Open Source Community especially Mozilla Community. You can Submit your details in [Google form](http://goo.gl/forms/h4ScnTIGFVDOOpH73) so we can contact you soon.
